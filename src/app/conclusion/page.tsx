      The data gathered here (debt-index and sentiments) don’t support Cochrane’s narrative that the Great Recession and Covid had different inflation trajectories because of differences in the ability of the Government to pay back its debts. The data from Reddit indicates that the sentiment of people on national debt and national deficit did not change from 2008 to 2024, and that the volume and scores of posts and comments indicate that debt discussion was common in the years after the Great Recession and Covid, a conclusion that is counter to Cochrane’s narrative. When looking at Google Trends data, the link between the popularity of terms related to government debt and expected inflation is weak or nonexistent.

      This data and the conclusions from it can’t be used to directly oppose Cochrane’s narrative, as there is no established link between sentiments and expected future surpluses in the narrative, nor must Reddit be representative of the population important for expected surpluses in the FTPL equation. However, it does leave less room for expected surpluses to be measured. In order for the FTPL to become more mainstream, there has to be a way for it to be falsified, and expected surplus is an area where falsifiability becomes challenging in the equation. Therefore, while my data doesn’t indicate any direct evidence on whether Cochrane’s narrative or the FTPL is right or wrong, it indicates the challenge to measure expected surpluses, and it does provide indirect evidence that expected surpluses can’t be affected by the popularity or sentiments of debt online. Further research should be done to find other potential avenues of measuring expected inflation or by diving deeper into other sources on the internet to measure debt sentiments or popularity of discussion.
